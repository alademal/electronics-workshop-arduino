# Arduino Electronics Workshop

This is the code for the Arduino portion of the Electronics workshop at 
Brentwood High School.

This will cover basic circuits, simple information technology, and
simple communication protocols. Most importantly, <i>these will have
to work first time,</i> because we will NOT have access to any computers
at Brentwood. We won't be able to reprogram the Arduinos. 

I will give more info about what I want coded at the meeting. I still 
haven't nailed down exactly what I want to do for this workshop, but 
I'll figure it out tonight.
